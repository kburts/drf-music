AngularJS/Django-Rest-Framework Music Player
=====

Goal
-----
Learn AngularJS (and JavaScript,) by writing an application which uses it as a frontend framework. Ideally, the Angular and django are going to be completely uncoupled, and the API will be served only locally while the Angular app will be served behind a reverse-proxy (probably nginx.)

Requirements:
-----
    Currently working with django1.7
    pip install -r requirements.txt
